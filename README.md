# AmpFit

This is a package that can be used to perform any three-body amplitude fit. I developed it as part of one of my PhD projects.

Due to official constraints, only some key parts of the source codes will be available on github as of now. The entire package will be posted as soon as I am free to do so.


Currently the language is primarily C++. However, I am working on certain python bindings to make it more user-friendly. 

Breit-Wigner, K-matrix, LASS and Flatte formulations are available for resonance descriptions.



(Go ahead, open the black box! :D)
